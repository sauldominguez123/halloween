    <p>As a child, Michael was admitted into a psychiatric
       hospital for the murder of his older sister,
       Judith Myers. After 15 years of captivity, 
       Myers broke out of the asylum and started his
        killing spree, with the intention to murder his
         remaining family relatives and anyone 
        who would get in his way.
